Two issues are left intentionally at this point. Let's see if we can solve them!

- It is possible to add a todo item without text
  place an [enabled] directive on the add button that only enables if there is some text in the textbox

- Todo items that have their completed status topggled do not persist until something else changes in the list.
  emit an event from the list item view, through the list view to the application component to tell the service to
  persists the change
